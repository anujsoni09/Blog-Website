            The foods you eat have big effects on your health and quality of life.<br><br>
            Although eating healthy can be fairly simple, the rise in popular “diets” and dieting trends has caused
            confusion.
            <br><br>
            In fact, these trends often distract from the basic nutrition principles that are most important.
            <br><br>
            This is a detailed beginner’s guide to healthy eating, based on the latest in nutrition science.
        </p>

        <br><br>


        <h3> Why Should You Eat Healthy?</h3>

        <p>
            Research continues to link serious diseases to a poor diet .<br><br>

            For example, eating healthy can drastically reduce your chances of developing heart
            disease and cancer, the world’s leading killers.
            <br><br>
            A good diet can improve all aspects of life, from brain function to physical performance.
            In fact, food affects all your cells and organs.
            <br><br>
            If you participate in exercise or sports, there is no doubt that a
            healthy diet will help you perform better.

        <h3>Calories and Energy Balance: Explained</h3>

        <p>
            In recent years, the importance of calories has been pushed aside.
            <br><br>
            While calorie counting isn’t always necessary, total calorie intake still plays a key role in weight control
            and
            health.
            <br><br>
            If you put in more calories than you burn, you will store them as new muscle or body
            fat. If you consume fewer calories than you burn every day, you will lose weight.
            <br>
            If you want to lose weight, you must create some form of calorie deficit .
            <br>
            In contrast, if you are trying to gain weight and increase muscle mass, then you need to eat more than your
            body
            burns.
        </p>

        <br><br>



        <h3>Understanding Macronutrients</h3>

        <p>
            The three macronutrients are carbohydrates (carbs), fats and protein.
            <br><br>
            These nutrients are needed in relatively large amounts. They provide calories and have various functions in
            your
            body.
            <br><br>
            Here are some common foods within each macronutrient group:
        <ul>
            <li>Carbs: 4 calories per gram. All starchy foods like bread, pasta and potatoes. Also includes fruit,
                legumes,
                juice,
                sugar and some dairy products.</li>
            <li>Protein: 4 calories per gram. Main sources include meat and fish, dairy, eggs, legumes and vegetarian
                alternatives like tofu.</li>
            <li>Fats: 9 calories per gram. Main sources include nuts, seeds, oils, butter, cheese, oily fish and fatty
                meat.
            </li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <p>
            How much of each macronutrient you should consume depends on your lifestyle and goals, as well as your
            personal
            preferences.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Micronutrients</h3>
        <p>
            Micronutrients are important vitamins and minerals that you require in smaller doses.
            <br><br>
            Some of the most common micronutrients you should know include:
            <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Magnesium: Plays a role in over 600 cellular processes, including energy production, nervous system
                function and muscle contraction.</li>
            <li>Potassium: This mineral is important for blood pressure control, fluid balance and the function of
                your muscles and nerves.</li>
            <li>Iron: Primarily known for carrying oxygen in the blood, iron also has many other benefits,
                including improved immune and brain function.</li>
            <li>Calcium: An important structural component of bones and teeth, and also a key mineral for your
                heart, muscles and nervous system.</li>
            <li>All vitamins: The vitamins, from vitamin A to K, play important roles in every organ and cell in your
                body.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            All of the vitamins and minerals are “essential” nutrients, meaning that you must get them from the diet in
            order to
            survive.
            <br><br>
            The daily requirement of each micronutrient varies between individuals. If you eat a real food-based
            diet that includes plants and animals, then you should get all the micronutrients your body needs without
            taking
            a supplement.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Foods to Eat</h3>

        <p>
        <p>Try to base your diet around these healthy food groups:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Vegetables:</b> These should play a fundamental role at most meals. They are low in calories yet full
                of important
                micronutrients and fiber.</li>
            <li><b>Fruits:</b> A natural sweet treat, fruit provides micronutrients and antioxidants that can help
                improve health.</li>
            <li><b>Meat and fish:</b> Meat and fish have been the major sources of protein throughout evolution. They
                are a staple
                in the human diet, although vegetarian and vegan diets have become popular as well.</li>
            <li><b>and seeds:</b> These are one of the best fat sources available and also contain important
                micronutrients.</li>
            <li><b>Eggs:</b> Considered one of the healthiest foods on the planet, whole eggs pack a powerful
                combination of protein,
                beneficial fats and micronutrients .</li>
            <li><b>Dairy:</b> Dairy products such as natural yogurt and milk are convenient, low-cost sources of protein
                and calcium.</li>
            <li><b>Healthy starches:</b> For those who aren’t on a low-carb diet, whole food starchy foods like
                potatoes, quinoa
                and Ezekiel bread are healthy and nutritious.</li>
            <li><b>Beans and legumes:</b> These are fantastic sources of fiber, protein and micronutrients.</li>
            <li><b>Beverages:</b> Water should make up the majority of your fluid intake, along with drinks like coffee
                and tea.</li>
            <li><b>Herbs and spices:</b> These are often very high in nutrients and beneficial plant compounds.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Combine Good Nutrition With Other Healthy Habits</h3>

        <p>
            Nutrition isn’t the only thing that matters for optimal health.
            <br><br>
            Following a healthy diet and exercising can give you an even bigger health boost.
            <br><br>
            It is also crucial to get good sleep. Research shows that sleep is just as important as nutrition for
            disease risk and weight control.
            <br><br>
            Hydration and water intake are also important. Drink when you’re thirsty and stay well hydrated all day.
            <br><br>
            Finally, try to minimize stress. Long-term stress is linked to many health problems.
        </p>
