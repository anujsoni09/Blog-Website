        <p>
            A healthy diet has been scientifically proven to provide numerous
            health benefits, such as reducing
            your risk of several chronic diseases and keeping your body healthy.However, making major changes to your
            diet can sometimes seem very overwhelming.Instead of making
            big
            changes, it may be
            better to start with a few smaller ones.

            <br><br>

            This article discusses 8 small changes that can make a regular diet a little bit healthier.
        </p>

        <br><br>


        <h3> 1.Slow Down </h3>

        <p> The pace at which you eat influences how much you eat, as well as how likely you are to gain weight.<br>
            In fact, studies comparing different eating speeds show that fast eaters are up to 115% more likely to be
            obese than slow eaters.
            Your appetite, how much you eat and how full you get is all controlled by hormones.<br><br> These hormones
            signal your brain whether you’re hungry or full.
            However, it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to receive these messages, so eating more slowly would
            give your brain the time it needs to perceive that you are full.
            Studies have confirmed this, showing that eating slowly may reduce the number of calories you consume at
            meals and help you lose weight .
            Eating slowly is also linked to more thorough chewing, which has also been linked to better weight
            maintenance .<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, simply by eating slower and chewing more often, you can reduce your risk of eating too much and
            gaining excess weight.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>2. Choose Whole-Grain Bread — Not Refined</h3>

        <p>
            You can easily make your diet a bit healthier by choosing whole grain bread in place of traditional
            refined-grain bread.
            As opposed to refined grains, which have been linked to many health issues, whole grains have been linked to
            a variety of
            health benefits, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.<br><br>
            They are also a good source of fiber, B vitamins and several minerals, such as zinc, iron, magnesiu and
            manganese.
            There are many varieties of whole-grain bread available, and many of them even
            taste better than refined bread.<br><br>
            Just make sure to read the label to ensure that your bread is made with whole grains only,
            not a mixture of whole
            and refined grains. It’s also preferable that the bread contains whole seeds or grains.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Add Greek Yogurt to Your Diet</h3>

        <p>
            It has been strained to remove its excess whey, which is the watery part of milk. The end result is a yogurt
            that is higher in fat and protein than regular yogurt.
            In fact, it contains up to three times the amount of protein found in the same amount of regular yogurt, or
            up to 9 grams per 100 grams.
            Eating a good source of protein helps you feel fuller for longer, helping you manage your appetite and eat
            fewer calories overall .
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, since Greek yogurt has been strained, it contains fewer carbs and lactose than regular yogurt,
            making it suitable for those who follow a low-carb diet or are lactose intolerant.
            Simply replace some snacks or regular yogurt varieties with Greek yogurt for a hefty dose of protein and
            nutrients.
            Just make sure to pick the non-flavored varieties, as flavored ones may be packed
            with added sugar and other unhealthy ingredients.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>4. Don’t Shop Without a List</h3>

        <p>
            There are two important strategies to employ when you go grocery shopping: make your shopping list ahead of
            time and don’t go to the store hungry.
            Not knowing exactly what you need makes room for impulse buying, while hunger can further exacerbate your
            impulses.
            <br><br>
            To make sure you don’t give in to your impulses, plan ahead and write down what you need beforehand.
            By doing this and sticking to your list, you will not only buy healthier items but also save money
            and have healthier foods around the house.
        </p>

        <br><br>


        <h3>5. Eat Eggs, Preferably for Breakfast</h3>

        <p>
            Eggs are incredibly healthy, especially if you eat them in the morning.
            They are rich in high-quality protein and many essential nutrients that people often don’t get enough of,
            such as choline.<br><br>
            When looking at studies comparing various types of calorie-matched breakfasts,
            eggs come out on top.<br><br>
            Eating eggs in the morning increases feelings of fullness. This has been shown to cause people to consume
            fewer calories over the next 36 hours, which can be quite
            helpful for weight loss .
            One study in healthy and fit young men showed that eggs caused significantly more fullness, less hunger and
            a
            lower desire to eat, compared to a breakfast consisting of cereal or croissants.
            <br><br>
            In fact, the men who had eggs for breakfast automatically ate 270–470 fewer calories at
            lunch and dinner buffets, compared to those who ate other breakfasts.
            Therefore, simply replacing your current breakfast with eggs may result in major benefits for your health.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>6. Increase Your Protein Intake</h3>

        <p>
            Protein is often referred to as the king of nutrients, and it does seem to have some superpowers.
            Due to its ability to affect your hunger and satiety hormones, it’s the most filling of the
            macronutrients.<br>
            <br><br>
            One study showed that simply increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% of calories made people eat 441 fewer
            calories per day, without actively restricting their intake.
            What’s more, protein helps you retain muscle mass, which determines the rate of your metabolism.
            A high protein intake may increase the number of calories you burn by 80–100 per day .
            This is especially important for preventing the loss of muscle mass that can occur during weight loss and as
            you age.
            <br><br>
            Aim to add a source of protein to each meal and snack. It will help you feel fuller for longer, curb
            cravings and make you less likely to overeat.
            Good sources of protein include dairy products, nuts, peanut butter, eggs, beans and lean meat.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>7. Drink Enough Water</h3>

        <p>
            Drinking enough water is important for your health.
            <br><br>
            Many studies have shown that drinking water may benefit weight loss, weight maintenance and even slightly
            increase the number of calories you burn daily .
            Studies also show that drinking water before meals can reduce appetite and calorie
            intake during the subsequent meal in middle-aged and older adults.
            That said, the most important thing is to drink water instead of other beverages. This may drastically
            reduce your sugar and calorie intake.

            <br><br>

            People who drink mostly water have been shown to consume 200 fewer calories per day,
            on average, than those who drink other beverages.

        <br><br>

        <h3>8. Bake or Roast Instead of Grilling or Frying</h3>

        <p>
            The way you prepare your food can drastically change its effects on your health.
            Grilling, broiling, frying and deep-frying are all popular methods of preparing meat and fish.<br><br>

            However, during these types of cooking methods, several potentially toxic compounds
            are formed, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), advanced glycation end products
            (AGEs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs). All of these compounds have been linked to several diseases,
            including cancer and heart disease.
            <br><br>
            Healthier cooking methods include baking, broiling, simmering, slow-cooking, poaching, pressure cooking,
            stewing and sous-vide.
            These methods do not promote the formation of these harmful compounds and thus make your food healthier.
            Nevertheless, there is nothing to say you can’t enjoy the occasional grill or deep-fry, but try to
            use those methods sparingly.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>

        <p>
            Completely overhauling your diet all at once can be a recipe for disaster.
            Instead, try to incorporate some of the small changes in this article to make your diet healthier.
            <br><br>
            Some of these tips will help you keep your portion sizes reasonable, while others will help you add
            nutrients or
            adapt to something new.
            Together, they’ll have a big impact on making your overall diet healthier and more sustainable, without a
            huge
            change in your habits.
