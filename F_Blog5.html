        <h3> </h3>
        <p>
            Successful muscle definition isn’t the result of luck or magic, but rather the culmination of hard-work and
            dedication to training and nutrition. Training alone will not result in muscle definition so it's important
            to keep your diet in check.

            <br><br>

        </p>
        <h3> But what is the right diet?</h3>
        <p>
            There are numerous contradictory arguments surrounding diet plans, but one discussion that’s at the
            forefront is whether a low-fat diet is more beneficial than a low-carb one. To add to the confusion, a 2015
            study conducted by the US National Institutes of Health found that while a low-fat diet loss led to more fat
            loss, a low-carb diet led to more weight loss overall.
            The conditions of the study were extremely niche however, putting patients through an extreme low-carb
            low-fat diet plan to achieve the results. This makes the process less relevant to most people’s everyday
            lifestyles, but nonetheless it raises an important notion – the best diet is the one that you stick to.


            <br><br>

        </p>
        <h3> CHOOSING THE RIGHT DIET PLAN TO GET LEAN</h3>
        <p>
            The most important thing for any diet is to maintain the right number of calories, which will be vary from
            person to person. If you’re looking to lose fat and increase muscle definition, then you need to be in an
            appropriate calorie deficit to help you reduce fat at a healthy rate. The NHS has a recommended weight loss
            plan which is designed help you reduce weight at a safe rate of 0.5kg to 1kg (1lb to 2lb) each week.
            If you want to track your calories, there are a number of free online calorie calculators available to get a
            rough estimate of how many calories to consume each day which is a good starting point. You can then use
            this number to guide you with how many calories to eat by tracking this using a calorie counter, such as
            MyFitnessPal, and see how you feel and how your body responds with this intake. You will probably find you
            will need to adjust your calories over time.


            <br><br>

        </p>
        <h3> Low-fat</h3>
        <p>
            If you’re opting for a low-fat diet plan to increase muscle definition, then you should add plenty of
            protein-rich foods to your regime. Create balanced meals by combining plenty of vegetables with protein,
            using low-fat foods such as:
            <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Chicken </li>
            <li> Beef </li>
            <li> Fish </li>
            <li> Eggs </li>
            <li> Dairy products </li>
        </ul>


        <br><br>

        </p>
        <h3>Low-carb </h3>
        <p>
            If you’re thinking of getting lean on a low-carb diet, try to get your carbohydrate sources from wholefoods
            and limit the amount of processed carbs you eat. Eliminating carbohydrates from your diet completely is not
            recommended or neither healthy.
            <br>You’ll want to ensure you get a balance of proteins, carbs, and fats. Consider the following:

        <ul>
            <li>Proteins: eggs, beef, chicken, cheese, fish </li>
            <li>Fats: nuts, fish oils, coconut oil </li>
            <li>Carbs: oats, rice, sweet potatoes, fruit, vegetables </li>
        </ul>




        <br><br>

        </p>
        <h3>CAN YOU LIVE WITHOUT CARBS? </h3>
        <p>
            Carbohydrates provide you with the fuel you need to lift weights and build muscle. Healthy carbs, such as
            high fibre starchy foods, vegetables, and fruits are also an important source of nutrients, including
            calcium, iron, and vitamin B.
            If you were to significantly reduce carbs from your diet in the long term, you could be at risk of seriously
            depleting your body’s nutrients, which can lead to several health issues. It’s important to maintain the
            right balance of carbs in your diet, as they can help in a number of useful ways, including:
            <br>

        <ul>
            <li>Increasing energy levels</li>
            <li> Reducing the risk of disease and infection</li>
            <li> Monitoring your calorie intake </li>
        </ul>




        <br><br>

        </p>


        <h3> CONCLUSION</h3>

        <p>
            Whether you opt for a more low-fat or low-carb diet, the importance of having a balanced diet cannot be
            underestimated. While you might want to try to limit the amount of fatty foods and carbohydrates you have,
            it's important to have a good mix of good proteins, fats, and carbs. In order to achieve fat loss and see
            muscle definition a combination of weight training and and being in an appropriate calorie deficit if
            recommended. Eliminating whole food groups can elicit fat loss through restricting your food choices but
            this will not be sustainable or healthy in the long term.
