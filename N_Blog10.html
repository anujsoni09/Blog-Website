        <p>
            Few nutrients are as important as protein. Not getting enough of it will affect your health and body
            composition.
            However, opinions regarding how much protein you need vary.
            Most official nutritional organizations recommend a fairly modest protein intake.
            The DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) is 0.36 grams of protein per pound (0.8 grams per kg) of body weight.
            <br><br>

            This amounts to:
        <ul>
            <li>56 grams per day for the average sedentary man</li>
            <li>46 grams per day for the average sedentary woman</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <p>
            This may be enough to prevent deficiency, but the amount you need depends on many factors, including your
            activity level, age, muscle mass, physique goals, and overall health.
            This article examines the optimal amounts of protein and how lifestyle factors like weight loss, muscle
            building, and activity levels factor in.

        <h3> What is protein, and why is it important? </h3>

        <p>
            Proteins are the main building blocks of your body. They’re used to make muscles, tendons, organs, and skin,
            as well as enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, and various molecules that serve many important functions.
            Proteins consist of smaller molecules called amino acids, which link together like beads on a string. These
            linked amino acids form long protein chains, which then fold into complex shapes.
            Your body produces some of these amino acids, but you must obtain others known as essential amino acids via
            your diet.
            <br><br>
            Protein is not only about quantity but also quality.
            Generally, animal protein provides all essential amino acids in the right ratio for you to make full use of
            them. This makes sense, as animal tissues are similar to your own tissues.
            If you’re eating animal products like meat, fish, eggs, or dairy every day, you’re likely getting enough
            protein.
            <br><br>
            However, if you don’t eat animal foods, getting all the protein and essential amino acids your body needs
            can be more challenging. If you’re following a plant-based diet, you may be interested in this article on
            the 17 best protein sources for vegans.
            Few people need to supplement with protein, but doing so can be useful for athletes and bodybuilders.

        <h3>Can aid weight loss and prevent weight gain</h3>

        <p>
            Protein is important when it comes to losing weight.
            As you may know, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn to lose weight.
            Evidence suggests that eating protein can increase the number of calories you burn by boosting your
            metabolic rate (calories out) and reducing your appetite (calories in).
            Consuming 25–30% of your total daily calories from protein has been shown to boost metabolism by up to
            80–100 calories per day, compared with lower protein diets.
            <br><br>
            Yet, protein’s most important contribution to weight loss is likely its ability to reduce appetite, leading
            to a reduction in calorie intake. Protein is better than fat or carbs at keeping you feeling full .
            In one study in men with obesity, consuming 25% of calories from protein increased feelings of fullness, as
            well as reduced late-night snacking desires and obsessive thoughts about food by 50% and 60%, respectively .
            In another 12-week study, women who increased their protein intake to 30% of calories ate 441 fewer calories
            per day and lost 11 pounds (5 kg) by simply adding more protein to their diet .
            Plus, protein does more than aid weight loss — it can likewise prevent weight gain.
            In one study, a modest increase in protein from 15% to 18% of calories reduced the amount of fat people
            regained after weight loss by 50% .
            A high protein intake also helps you build and preserve muscle mass, which burns a small number of calories
            around the clock.
            Eating more protein makes it much easier to stick to any weight loss diet — be it high carb, low carb, or
            something in between.
            <br><br>
            According to the previously mentioned studies, a protein intake of around 30% of calories may be optimal for
            weight loss. This amounts to 150 grams per day for someone on a 2,000-calorie diet.
            You can calculate it by multiplying your calorie intake by 0.075.
