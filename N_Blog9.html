        <p>
            Micronutrients are one of the major groups of nutrients your body needs. They include vitamins and minerals.
            Vitamins are necessary for energy production, immune function, blood clotting and other functions.
            Meanwhile, minerals play an important role in growth, bone health, fluid balance and several other
            processes.
            <br><br>
            This article provides a detailed overview of micronutrients, their functions and implications of excess
            consumption or deficiency.

        </p>

        <br><br>




        <h3> What Are Micronutrients?</h3>

        <p>
            The term micronutrients is used to describe vitamins and minerals in general.
            Macronutrients, on the other hand, include proteins, fats and carbohydrates.
            Your body needs smaller amounts of micronutrients relative to macronutrients. That’s why they’re labeled
            “micro.”
            <br><br>
            Humans must obtain micronutrients from food since your body cannot produce vitamins and minerals — for the
            most part. That’s why they’re also referred to as essential nutrients.
            Vitamins are organic compounds made by plants and animals which can be broken down by heat, acid or air. On
            the other hand, minerals are inorganic, exist in soil or water and cannot be broken down.
            When you eat, you consume the vitamins that plants and animals created or the minerals they absorbed.
            <br><br>
            The micronutrient content of each food is different, so it’s best to eat a variety of foods to get enough
            vitamins and minerals.
            An adequate intake of all micronutrients is necessary for optimal health, as each vitamin and mineral has a
            specific role in your body.
            Vitamins and minerals are vital for growth, immune function, brain development and many other important
            functions .
            Depending on their function, certain micronutrients also play a role in preventing and fighting disease .

        <h3>Types and Functions of Micronutrients</h3>

        <p>
            Vitamins and minerals can be divided into four categories: water-soluble vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins,
            macrominerals and trace minerals.
            Regardless of type, vitamins and minerals are absorbed in similar ways in your body and interact in many
            processes.
        </p>

        <h4>Water-Soluble Vitamins</h4>

        <p>
            Most vitamins dissolve in water and are therefore known as water-soluble. They’re not easily stored in your
            body and get flushed out with urine when consumed in excess.
            While each water-soluble vitamin has a unique role, their functions are related.
            For example, most B vitamins act as coenzymes that help trigger important chemical reactions. A lot of these
            reactions are necessary for energy production.
            <br><br>
            The water-soluble vitamins — with some of their functions — are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Vitamin B1 (thiamine):</b> Helps convert nutrients into energy.</li>
            <li><b>Vitamin B2 (riboflavin):</b> Necessary for energy production, cell function and fat metabolism.</li>
            <li><b>Vitamin B3 (niacin):</b> Drives the production of energy from food.</li>
            <li><b>Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid):</b> Necessary for fatty acid synthesis.</li>
            <li><b>Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine):</b> Helps your body release sugar from stored carbohydrates for energy and
                create
                red blood cells.</li>
            <li><b>Vitamin B7 (biotin):</b> Plays a role in the metabolism of fatty acids, amino acids and glucose.</li>
            <li><b>Vitamin B9 (folate):</b> Important for proper cell division.</li>
            <li><b>Vitamin B12 (cobalamin):</b> Necessary for red blood cell formation and proper nervous system and
                brain
                function.</li>
            <li><b>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid):</b> Required for the creation of neurotransmitters and collagen, the main
                protein
                in your skin.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <p>
            As you can see, water-soluble vitamins play an important role in producing energy but also have several
            other
            functions.
            Since these vitamins are not stored in your body, it’s important to get enough of them from food.

        </p>

        <br><br>



        <h4>Fat-Soluble Vitamins</h4>

        <p>
            Fat-soluble vitamins do not dissolve in water.
            They’re best absorbed when consumed alongside a source of fat. After consumption, fat-soluble vitamins are
            stored in your liver and fatty tissues for future use.
            <br><br>
            The names and functions of fat-soluble vitamins are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Vitamin A:</b> Necessary for proper vision and organ function.</li>
            <li><b>Vitamin D:</b> Promotes proper immune function and assists in calcium absorption and bone growth.
            </li>
            <li><b>Vitamin E:</b> Assists immune function and acts as an antioxidant that protects cells from damage.
            </li>
            <li><b>Vitamin K:</b> Required for blood clotting and proper bone development.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <h3>Macrominerals</h3>

        <p>
            Macrominerals are needed in larger amounts than trace minerals in order to perform their specific roles in
            your body.
            <br><br>
            The macrominerals and some of their functions are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Calcium:</b> Necessary for proper structure and function of bones and teeth. Assists in muscle
                function and
                blood vessel contraction.</li>
            <li><b>Phosphorus:</b> Part of bone and cell membrane structure.</li>
            <li><b>Magnesium:</b> Assists with over 300 enzyme reactions, including regulation of blood pressure.</li>
            <li><b>Sodium:</b> Electrolyte that aids fluid balance and maintenance of blood pressure.</li>
            <li><b>Chloride</b> Often found in combination with sodium. Helps maintain fluid balance and is used to make
                digestive juices .</li>
            <li><b>Potassium:</b> Electrolyte that maintains fluid status in cells and helps with nerve transmission and
                muscle
                function .</li>
            <li><b>Sulfur:</b> Part of every living tissue and contained in the amino acids methionine and cysteine .
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <br><br>



        <h3>Micronutrient Supplements</h3>

        <p>
            The safest and most effective way to get adequate vitamin and mineral intake appears to be from food source.
            More research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of toxicities and supplements.
            However, people at risk of specific nutrient deficiencies may benefit from taking supplements under the
            supervision of a doctor.

            <br><br>
            If you’re interested in taking micronutrient supplements, look for products certified by a third party.
            Unless otherwise directed by a healthcare provider, be sure to avoid products that contain “super” or “mega”
            doses of any nutrient.
