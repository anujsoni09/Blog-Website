        <p>
            Real food is food that is as close to its natural state as possible.

            <br><br>

            It is primarily:

        <ul>
            <li>unprocessed</li>
            <li>free of chemical additives</li>
            <li>rich in nutrients</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            However, since processed foods became popular in the 20th century, the Western diet has shifted more toward
            ready-to-eat meals.

            While processed foods are convenient, they can also potentially affect your health. So following a diet
            based on
            real food may be one of the most important things you can do to help maintain good health.

            Here are 9 reasons to eat real food.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3> 1. Loaded with important nutrients</h3>

        <p>
            Unprocessed animal and plant foods can help provide vitamins and minerals you need for optimal health.

            For instance, 1 cup (149 grams) of red bell peppers, kiwi (180mg) or orange slices
            (165 grams) contains more than 100% of the RDI for vitamin C .

            Eggs and liver are especially high in choline, a nutrient essential for proper brain function
            .

            And a single Brazil nut provides all the selenium you need for an entire day .

            In fact, most whole foods are good sources of vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial nutrients.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>2. Low in sugar</h3>

        <p>
            Some research suggests that eating sugary foods can increase your risk for obesity, insulin resistance,
            type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and heart disease .

            Generally speaking, real foods tend to be lower in added sugar than many processed foods.

            Even though fruit contains sugar, it’s also high in water and fiber, making it much healthier
            option than having soda and processed foods.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3> 3.Heart healthy</h3>

        <p>
            Real food is packed with antioxidants and nutrients that support heart health, including magnesium
            and healthy fats.

            Eating a diet rich in nutritious, unprocessed foods may also help reduce inflammation,
            which is considered one of the major drivers of heart disease.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3> 4.Better for the environment</h3>

        <p>
            The world population is steadily growing, and with this growth comes increased demand for food.

            However, producing food for billions of people can take a toll on the environment.

            This is partly due to the destruction of rainforests for agricultural land,
            increased fuel needs, pesticide use, greenhouse gases, and packaging that ends up in landfills.

            Developing sustainable agriculture based on real food may help improve the health
            of the planet by reducing energy needs and decreasing the amount of nonbiodegradable
            waste that humans produce.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3> 5. High in fiber</h3>

        <p>
            Fiber provides many health benefits, including boosting digestive function,
            metabolic health, and feelings of fullness.

            Foods like avocados, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and blackberries are particularly
            high in healthy fiber, alongside beans and legumes.

            Consuming fiber through whole foods is better than taking a supplement as it keeps you feeling fuller
            longer, and you also get the added nutrients from the fruit or vegetable.
        </p>

        <br><br>




        <h3>6. Helps manage blood sugar</h3>

        <p>
            According to the International Diabetes Federation, more than 450 million people live with diabetes
            worldwide.

            That number is expected to rise to 700 million by 2045.

            Eating a diet high in fibrous plants and unprocessed animal foods may help
            reduce blood sugar levels in people who have or are at risk for diabetes.

            In one 12-week study, people with diabetes or prediabetes followed a paleolithic
            diet combining fresh meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, eggs, and nuts. They experienced
            a 26% reduction in blood sugar levels.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3> 7. Good for your skin</h3>

        <p>
            In addition to promoting better overall health, real food can help nourish
            and protect your skin.

            For instance, dark chocolate and avocados have been shown to protect skin
            against sun damage.

            Studies suggest that eating more vegetables, fish, beans, and olive oil may
            help reduce wrinkling, loss of elasticity, and other age-related skin changes.

            What’s more, switching from a Western diet high in processed foods to one based on real food
            may help prevent or reduce acne.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3> 8. High in healthy fats</h3>

        <p>
            Unlike the trans and processed fats found in vegetable oils and some spreads,
            most naturally occurring fats are better to have.

            For example, extra virgin olive oil is a great source of oleic acid,
            a monounsaturated fat that promotes heart health .

            Coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides, which may increase fat
            burning and assist with weight loss.

            What’s more, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids help fight inflammation and protect
            heart health. Fatty fish, such as salmon, herring, and sardines, are excellent sources .

            Other real foods that are high in healthy fats include avocados, nuts, and seeds.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>9. May reduce disease risk</h3>

        <p>
            Making real food part of your lifestyle may help reduce your risk for disease.

            Eating patterns — like the Mediterranean diet — based on whole, unprocessed foods
            have been shown to reduce your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome .

            In addition, several large observational studies link a balanced diet heavy in fruits
            and vegetables to a decreased risk of cancer and heart disease.
