        <p>“Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food.”

            <br>

            Those are famous words from the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, often called the father of Western
            medicine.
            He actually used to prescribe garlic to treat a variety of medical conditions.
            Modern science has recently confirmed many of these beneficial health effects.

            <br><br>

            Here are 4 health benefits of garlic that are supported by human research.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Garlic Contains Compounds With Potent Medicinal Properties </h3>

        <p>
            Garlic is a plant in the Allium (onion) family.
            <br><br>
            It is closely related to onions, shallots and leeks. Each segment of a garlic bulb is called a clove. There
            are about 10–20 cloves in a single bulb, give or take.
            Garlic grows in many parts of the world and is a popular ingredient in cooking due to its strong smell and
            delicious taste.
            <br><br>
            However, throughout ancient history, the main use of garlic was for its health and medicinal properties .
            Its use was well documented by many major civilizations, including the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks,
            Romans and Chinese .
            Scientists now know that most of its health benefits are caused by sulfur compounds formed when a garlic
            clove is chopped, crushed or chewed.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps the most famous of those is known as allicin. However, allicin is an unstable compound that is only
            briefly present in fresh garlic after it’s been cut or crushed .
            Other compounds that may play a role in garlic’s health benefits include diallyl disulfide and s-allyl
            cysteine .
            <br><br>
            The sulfur compounds from garlic enter the body from the digestive tract and travel all over the body, where
            it exerts its potent biological effects.

        <h3>2. Garlic Is Highly Nutritious But Has Very Few Calories</h3>

        <p>
            Calorie for calorie, garlic is incredibly nutritious.

            One clove (3 grams) of raw garlic contains :
        <ul>
            <li>Manganese: 2% of the Daily Value (DV)</li>
            <li>Vitamin B6: 2% of the DV</li>
            <li>Vitamin C: 1% of the DV</li>
            <li>Selenium: 1% of the DV</li>
            <li>Fiber: 0.06 grams</li>
            <li>Decent amounts of calcium, copper, potassium, phosphorus, iron and vitamin B1</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This comes with 4.5 calories, 0.2 grams of protein and 1 gram of carbs.
            Garlic also contains trace amounts of various other nutrients. In fact, it contains a little bit of almost
            everything you need.

        <h3>3. Garlic Improves Cholesterol Levels, Which May Lower the Risk of Heart Disease</h3>

        <p>
            Garlic can lower total and LDL cholesterol.
            For those with high cholesterol, garlic supplements appear to reduce total and/or LDL cholesterol by about
            10–15%.
            <br><br>
            Looking at LDL (the “bad”) and HDL (the “good”) cholesterol specifically, garlic appears to lower LDL but
            has no reliable effect on HDL .
            High triglyceride levels are another known risk factor for heart disease, but garlic seems to have no
            significant effects on triglyceride levels .
